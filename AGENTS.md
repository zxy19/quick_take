## CRITICAL: Tool Usage Mandate

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. VIOLATING THIS RULE MEANS CORRUPTED RESULTS AND WASTED TIME.**

When viewing **ANY file within this project** or **ANY class from external dependencies/libraries** (NeoForge, Minecraft, etc.), you **MUST ALWAYS** use the IDE-provided MCP tools:

- `idea_read_file` — for reading project files
- `idea_get_file_text_by_path` — for reading project files by path
- `idea_search_symbol` — for looking up classes/methods/fields by name
- `idea_get_symbol_info` — for inspecting a specific symbol's declaration

**YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN FROM USING**: `Read` tool (local filesystem read), `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash` file operations, or any other non-IDE tool to **read, search, or inspect** project source files or dependency classes.

**When editing/writing code**, you may use any tool: `Edit`, `Write`, `idea_replace_text_in_file`, `idea_create_new_file` are all acceptable. There is no restriction on editing tools.

**THE ONLY EXCEPTION** is for non-Java files like `build.gradle`, `gradle.properties`, JSON resources, Gradle wrapper, `.gitignore`, and other config/asset files — these may be read with any tool.

**IF ANY IDE MCP TOOL FAILS OR RETURNS AN ERROR, OR IF THE TOOLS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT:**
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY.** Do NOT proceed. Do NOT attempt to fall back to other tools.
2. Report the exact error clearly to the user and wait for instructions.
3. Under no circumstances attempt to read project Java files or dependency classes through alternative means.

This requirement exists because the IDE MCP tools understand Java semantics, resolve symbols correctly, navigate inheritance hierarchies, and decompile class files — capabilities that raw filesystem tools lack. Using raw tools on Java source will produce incomplete, misleading, or flat-out wrong results.
